Comprehensive Analysis of Solana and Ethereum Contributors Using GitHub API with Comparative Study of 1000 Random GitHub Profiles
Client Background
Client:A leading IT & tech firm in the USA
Industry Type:IT
Products & Services:IT Consulting, IT Support, SaaS
Organization Size:200+
The Problem
Perform analysis of all contributor’s profiles of Solana and Ethereum repository by collecting information through GitHub API then perform analysis of all random 1000 Github user’s profile.
Our Solution
To achieve this analysis first, we need to extract each GitHub user’s data. These user data are retrieved from the most popular repository.
These are the following features which will impact on good developer.
From github_username will fetch the all feature as follows 1) total_repos 2) total_contribution (all repos) 3) total_forks 4) total_stars 5) total_achievements 6) popularity 7) total_code_review 8) total_issues 9) total comments
popularity_score = ((((stars * weight_stars) + (forks * weight_forks) + (contributions * weight_contributions)) / max_value_among_all_repositories) * weight_popularity)
impact_score = num_commits * weight_commits + num_reviewers * weight_reviewers + num_comments * weight_comments + num_issues * weight_issues )
Combined Score = Popularity Score + Impact Score
Solution Architecture
Deliverables
Analysis of Filtered 760 users data , 790 solana and ethereum user data and 1000 random people dataset
Tech Stack
What are the technical Challenges Faced during Project Execution
Fetching all the GitHub features from GitHub API was a time-consuming process.
How the Technical Challenges were Solved
I solved this problem by parallel processing and creating checkpoints to save the data collected if the API limit was exceeded.
Business Impact
Analyzing the profiles of contributors to Solana and Ethereum repositories through the GitHub API and conducting a similar assessment of random 1000 GitHub users provides critical insights for strategic decision-making, community engagement, and resource optimization. This analysis enables the identification of key contributors, assessment of project quality and sustainability, and efficient allocation of resources based on diverse skill sets. It mitigates risks associated with dependency on a few contributors, aids talent acquisition and retention, and benchmarks the platforms’ competitiveness. Additionally, it guides innovation, and compliance measures, and ensures business continuity by proactively addressing potential disruptions. Overall, this in-depth analysis serves as a valuable tool for enhancing the vitality, innovation, and longevity of blockchain projects on Solana and Ethereum.
