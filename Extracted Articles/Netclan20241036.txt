PowerBI REST API – Fetching Dataflow and Refresh Schedules with semantic models
Client Background
Client:A leading IT & tech firm in the USA
Industry Type:IT
Products & Services:IT Consulting, IT Support, SaaS
Organization Size:200+
The Problem
Our client, a large enterprise, faced significant challenges in managing their Power BI dataflows, datasets, and refresh schedules across multiple workspaces. The manual processes were time-consuming, error-prone, and lacked real-time monitoring capabilities. They needed an automated solution to streamline these tasks, ensure data accuracy, and improve overall efficiency.
Our Solution
We developed an automated system using Python that integrated with the Power BI API to manage and monitor dataflows, datasets, and their refresh schedules. The solution provided a comprehensive overview of all workspaces, datasets, and dataflows, including detailed transaction data and refresh schedules. This system allowed the client to efficiently track and manage their Power BI environment, reducing manual effort and improving data reliability.
