Now we need your help to visualize the data so that we can interpret it.I also have the original export file from LinkedIn. I want to answer this business question:For the LinkedIn posts that received the highest engagement, which keywords, phrases, and hashtags were most commonly used?
I want to match up Engagement Rate with key phrase analysis. The business question is this: For the LinkedIn posts that received the highest engagement, what were the most common keywords, phrases and hashtags used?
Beyond matching to Engagement Rate, please check if there is a way to also view the data according to Impressions and Likes.
